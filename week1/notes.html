        <h1>Notes Week 1 - Local Storage</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>During the week I learned about local storage. From what I understand, local storage
            is data saved in the browser regardless of whether it opened or it is closed.
            Anyone can save his or her data from a website, this data is then stored locally to
            their computer, and it will still be there after leaving the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            An example I thought of is in my iPhone. I visited many websites for which I have
            a profile. That means that I typically have a username and password in order to
            access my profile with all of it's information. When logging into a site for the
            first time, I save my name and password to my phones local storage, not the website
            itself. That way, when logging back into my profile, my iPhone retrieves my username
            and password from the local storage so that I can log in.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the book I went through the example of a story editor. You can write a story, give
            it a name and save it locally. Here are the functions that allowed me to use local storage.
        </p>
        <p>
            function loadStory(){
                var storyName = document.getElementById("name_input").value
                var storyHTML = localStorage.getItem("storyName")
                document.getElementById("story_editor").value = storyHTML
            }
            function saveStory(){
                var storyName = document.getElementById("name_input").value
                var storyHTML = document.getElementById("story_editor").value
                localStorage.setItem(storyName, storyHTML)
            }
            function displayStory(){
                var storyHTML = document.getElementById("story_editor").value
                document.getElementById("story_display").innerHTML = storyHTML
            }
        </p>
        <ul>
            <h3>Question</h3>
            <li>What is the difference of putting the ol list in the HTML over making it in js?</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>SitePoint</h3>
        <p>In the SitePoint Video, I was able to understand that float labels help so you don't lose the 
            text when you start typing. Autofill is good for phones. If the user is entering numbers, use 
            the number keypad. Link phone numbers to click and call instead of copy and paste.
            Keep advertising smaller and then reveal when clicked. Do not use pop ups and popovers.</p>
